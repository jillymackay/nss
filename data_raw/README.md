# About data_raw

Before I build this package, I run the code files which are stored in this **data_raw** folder. This is the code which generates the `nss` object, and the `nss` object is then built by the package. 

When you download the package, your machine does not need to build anything, but should be able to find the documented `nss` object. 

If you want to know how the `nss` sausage gets made, you can recreate the process by downloading the following files and running the code in this folder yourself.
